#Color Picker

#Overall
<p>React exercise with functions, components, and passing in props</p>
<p>When button is clicked, chooseColor function is called to randomly choose 3 numbers between 1 and 256. This creates a RGB color which changes the state of className (associated with the background and button color).</p>
